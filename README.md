# Job Portal Backend

It is a RESTful API where Users can use :
-Register and Log in using Json Web Token Authentication
-User can post the job openings
-User can apply for the job
-User can fetch the job openings
-Backend is built using Node.js,Express.js,MongoDB,WebSockets.
-Used Rate Limiting where a user can make 100 requests per 15 minutes.
-Tried implementing OPENAI API job recommendation but got a rate limit error due to quota restrictions.
Error Message:RateLimitError: 429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
